"""
This file stores a subclass of CassiopeiaSolver, the HybridSolver. This solver
consists of two sub-solvers -- a top (greedy) and a bottom solver. The greedy
solver will be applied until a certain criteria is reached (be it a maximum LCA 
distance or a number of cells) and then another solver is employed to
infer relationships at the bottom of the phylogeny under construction.

In Jones et al, the Cassiopeia-Hybrid algorithm is a HybridSolver that consists
of a VanillaGreedySolver stacked on top of a ILPSolver instance.

    HybridSolver is an class representing the structure of Cassiopeia Hybrid
    inference algorithms. The solver procedure contains logic for building tree
    starting with a top-down greedy algorithm until a predetermined criteria is
    reached at which point a more complex algorithm is used to reconstruct each
    subproblem. The top-down algorithm _must_ be a subclass of a GreedySolver
    as it must have functions `find_split` and `perform_split`. The solver
    employed at the bottom of the tree can be any CassiopeiaSolver subclass and
    need only have a `solve` method.
