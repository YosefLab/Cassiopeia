This file stores a subclass of CassiopeiaSolver, the DistanceSolver. Generally,
the inference procedures that inherit from this method will need to implement
methods for selecting "cherries" and updating the dissimilarity map. Methods
that will inherit from this class by default are Neighbor-Joining and UPGMA.
There may be other subclasses of this.

    This solver serves as a generic Distance-based solver. Briefly, all of the
    classes that derive from this class will use a dissimilarity map to
    iteratively choose samples to merge and update the dissimilarity map
    based on this merging. An example of a derived class is the
    NeighborJoiningSolver which uses the Q-criterion to iteratively join
    samples until no samples remain.

    TODO(mgjones, sprillo, rzhang): Specify functions to use for rooting, etc.
        the trees that are produced via a DistanceSolver. Add compositional
        framework.

    TODO(mgjones, rzhang): Make the solver work with similarity maps as
        flattened arrays

    Args:
        dissimilarity_function: Function that can be used to compute the
            dissimilarity between samples.
        add_root: Whether or not to add an implicit root the tree. Only
            pertinent in algorithms that return an unrooted tree, by default
            (e.g. Neighbor Joining). Will not override an explicitly defined
            root, specified by the 'root_sample_name' attribute in the
            CassiopeiaTree
        prior_transformation: Function to use when transforming priors into
            weights. Supports the following transformations:
                "negative_log": Transforms each probability by the negative
                    log (default)
                "inverse": Transforms each probability p by taking 1/p
                "square_root_inverse": Transforms each probability by the
                    the square root of 1/p

    Attributes:
        dissimilarity_function: Function used to compute dissimilarity between
            samples.
        add_root: Whether or not to add an implicit root the tree.
        prior_transformation: Function to use when transforming priors into
