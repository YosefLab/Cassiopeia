    A Greedy Cassiopeia solver.

    GreedySolver is an abstract class representing the structure of top-down
    inference algorithms. The solver procedure contains logic to build a tree
    from the root by recursively partitioning the set of samples. Each subclass
    will implement "perform_split", which is the procedure for successively
    partioning the sample set.

    Args:
        prior_transformation: Function to use when transforming priors into
            weights. Supports the following transformations:
                "negative_log": Transforms each probability by the negative
                    log (default)
                "inverse": Transforms each probability p by taking 1/p
                "square_root_inverse": Transforms each probability by the
                    the square root of 1/p

        prior_transformation: Function to use when transforming priors into
            weights.
