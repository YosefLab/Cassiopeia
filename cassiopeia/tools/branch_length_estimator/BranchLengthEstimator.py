    Abstract base class for all branch length estimators.

    A BranchLengthEstimator implements a method estimate_branch_lengths which,
    given a Tree with lineage tracing character vectors at the leaves (and
    possibly at the internal nodes too), estimates the branch lengths of the
    tree.
