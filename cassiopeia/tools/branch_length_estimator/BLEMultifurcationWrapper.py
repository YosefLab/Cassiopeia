class BLEMultifurcationWrapper(BranchLengthEstimator):
    r"""
    Wraps a BranchLengthEstimator.
    When estimating branch lengths:
    1) the tree topology is first copied out
    2) then multifurcations in the tree topology are resolved into a binary
        structure,
    3) then branch lengths are estimated on this binary topology
    4) finally, the node ages are copied back onto the original tree.
    Maximum Parsimony will be used to reconstruct the ancestral states.
