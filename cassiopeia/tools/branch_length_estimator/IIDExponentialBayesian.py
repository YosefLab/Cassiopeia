    Inference under a subsampled Birth Process with IID memoryless mutations.

    In more detail, his model assumes that CRISPR/Cas9 mutates each site
    independently and identically, with an exponential waiting time; and that
    the phylogeny follows a subsampled Birth Process. It further assumes that
    the tree has depth exactly 1. Conditional on the observed topology and on
    the character data, the posterior mean branch lengths are used as branch
    length estimates.

    This estimator requires that the ancestral characters be provided (these
    can be imputed with CassiopeiaTree's reconstruct_ancestral_characters
    method if they are not known, which is usually the case for real data).

    This estimator also assumes that the tree is binary (except for the root,
    which should have degree 1).

    Missing states are treated as missing at random by the model.
