    """
    MLE under a model of IID memoryless CRISPR/Cas9 mutations.

    In more detail, this model assumes that CRISPR/Cas9 mutates each site
    independently and identically, with an exponential waiting time. The
    tree is assumed to have depth exactly 1, and the user can provide a
    minimum branch length. Pseudocounts in the form of fictitious mutations and
    non-mutations can be added to regularize the MLE.

    The relative depth of each leaf can be specified to relax the ultrametric
    constraint. Also, the identicality assumption can be relaxed by providing
    the relative mutation rate of each site.

    The MLE under this set of assumptions is a special kind of convex
    optimization problem known as an exponential cone program, which can be
    readily solved with off-the-shelf (open source) solvers.

    Ancestral states may or may not all be provided. We recommend imputing them
    using the cassiopeia.tools.conservative_maximum_parsimony function.

    Missing states are treated as missing always completely at random (MACAR) by
    the model.

    The estimated mutation rate(s) will be stored as an attribute called
    `mutation_rate`. The log-likelihood will be stored as an attribute
    called `log_likelihood`. The penalized log-likelihood will be stored as an
    attribute called `penalized_log_likelihood` (the penalized log-likelihood
    includes the pseudocounts, whereas the log-likelihood does not).

    Args:
        minimum_branch_length: Estimated branch lengths will be constrained to
            have length at least this value. By default it is set to 0.01,
            since the MLE tends to collapse mutationless edges to length 0.
        pseudo_mutations_per_edge: Regularization whereby we add this number of
            fictitious mutations to each edge in the tree.
        pseudo_non_mutations_per_edge: Regularization whereby we add this number
            of fictitious non-mutations to each edge in the tree.
        relative_leaf_depth: If provided, the relative depth of each leaf in the
            tree. This allows relaxing the ultrametric assumption to deal with
            the case where the tree is not ultrametric but the relative leaf
            depths are known.
        relative_mutation_rates: List of positive floats of length equal to the
            number of character sites. Number at each character site indicates
            the relative mutation rate at that site. Must be fully specified or
            None in which case all sites are assumed to evolve at the same rate.
            None is the default value for this argument.
        solver: Convex optimization solver to use. Can be "SCS", "ECOS", or
            "MOSEK". Note that "MOSEK" solver should be installed separately.
            We recommend "ECOS" (which is the default).
        backup_solver: In case the main solver fails, this backup solver will
            be tried instead. Useful for applying a faster but less
            sophisticated solver first, and only falling back to a very
            reliable but slower solver if needed. We recommend "SCS" (which is
            the default). (If `backup_solver=None` is provided, no retry will be
            attempted and an error will be raised immediately if the main solver
            fails.)
        pendant_branch_minimum_branch_length_multiplier: For pendant edges in
            the tree (i.e. those corresponding to leaf nodes), the minimum
            branch length constraint does not really apply since leaves do not
            correspond to cell divisions. By default the constraint will be
            applied. Thus, we can turn off the constraint
            by setting pendant_branch_minimum_branch_length_multiplier=0.
            An intermediate option would be
            pendant_branch_minimum_branch_length_multiplier=0.5.
        _use_vectorized_implementation: Toggles between vectorized and
            non-vectorized implementations. Only used for profiling purposes.
        verbose: Verbosity level.

    Attributes:
        mutation_rate: The estimated CRISPR/Cas9 mutation rate(s), assuming that
            the tree has depth exactly 1.
        log_likelihood: The log-likelihood of the training data under the
            estimated model.
        penalized_log_likelihood: The penalized log-likelihood (i.e., with
            pseudocounts) of the training data under the estimated model.
        minimum_branch_length: The minimum branch length (which was provided
            during initialization).
        pseudo_mutations_per_edge: The number of fictitious mutations added to
            each edge to regularize the MLE (which was provided during
            initialization).
        pseudo_non_mutations_per_edge: The number of fictitious non-mutations
            added to each edge to regularize the MLE (which was provided during
            initialization).
