    """Imputes data based on spatial location.

    This procedure iterates over spots in a given anndata and imputes missing
    data based on spatial neigborhoods.
    
    The procedure is an interative algorithm where for each iteration a missing
    character is imputed based on the neighborhood of a node. Node neighborhoods
    are built off of a spatial graph that can passed in directly or inferred
    from a specified spatial anndata. In the simplest example, node neighobrhoods
    are just the immediate neighbors of a node, but users can also include
    neighbors-of-neighbors (and neighbors-of-neighbors-of-neighbors, so on)
    using the `imputation_hops` argument. An imputation will be accepted if the
    fraction of neighbors that agree with an observed non-zero allele exceeds
    the specified `imputation_concordance` threshold (by default 0.8). This
    procedure can be repeated for several rounds, controlled by the
    `num_imputation_iterations` argument and in this way approximates a
    message-passing process.

    Args:
        character_matrix: A character matrix of spots, constructed using a
            function like `convert_allele_table_to_character_matrix`.
        adata: Anndata of spatially-resolved data. Only the spatial coordinates
            need to be stored, and this is used to construct a graph.
        spatial_graph: Optionally, the user can provide a spatial connectivity
            graph instead of passing in an adata.
        neighborhood_size: If a connectivitity graph is being constructed,
            this is the number of nearest neighbors to connect to a node. If
            both neighborhood_size and neighborhood_radius are passed in,
            neighborhood_size is preferred.
        neighborhood_radius: Intead of passing in `neighborhood_size`, this
            is the radius of the connectivity graph.
        imputation_hops: Number of adjacent node's adjacencies to query. For
            example, if this is 2, this means that imputation is done not just
            on nearest neighbors of a given node, but also each nearest
            neighbor's nearest neighbors.
        imputation_concordance: Fraction of votes that must agree in order
            to accept an imputation.
        num_imputation_iterations: Number of iterations for imputation
            procedure.
        max_neighbor_distance: Maximum distance to neighbor to be used for
            imputation.
        coordinates: If an AnnData is not specified, and you wish to set an
            upper limit on the distance for spatial imputation, these
            coordinates can be passed to the imputation procedure.
        connect_key: Key used to store spatial connectivities in 
            `adata.obsp`. This will be passed into the `key_added` argument
            of sq.gr.spatial_neighbors and an etnry in `adata.obsp` will be added
            of the form `{connect_key}_connectivities`. 

    Returns:
        An imputed character matrix.
