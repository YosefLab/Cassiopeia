    """Simulator class for a forward birth-death process with fitness in a population with ecDNA.

        "Implements a flexible phylogenetic tree simulator using a forward birth-
        death process. In this process starting from an initial root lineage,
        births represent the branching of a new lineage and death represents the
        cessation of an existing lineage. The process is represented as a tree,
        with internal nodes representing division events, branch lengths
        representing the lifetimes of individuals, and leaves representing samples
        observed at the end of the experiment.

        Allows any distribution on birth and death waiting times to
        be specified, including constant, exponential, weibull, etc. If no death
        waiting time distribution is provided, the process reduces to a Yule birth
        process. Also robustly simulates differing fitness on lineages within a
        simulated tree. Fitness in this context represents potential mutations that
        may be acquired on a lineage that change the rate at which new members are
        born. Each lineage maintains its own birth scale parameter, altered from an
        initial specified experiment-wide birth scale parameter by accrued
        mutations. Different fitness regimes can be specified based on user
        provided distributions on how often fitness mutations occur and their
        respective strengths.

        There are two stopping conditions for the simulation. The first is "number
        of extant nodes", which specifies the simulation to run until the first
        moment a number of extant nodes exist. The second is "experiment time",
        which specifies the time at which lineages are sampled. At least one of
        these two stopping criteria must be provided. Both can be provided in which
        case the simulation is run until one of the stopping conditions is reached."

    Args:
        birth_waiting_distribution: A function that samples waiting times
            from the birth distribution. Determines how often births occur.
            Must take a scale parameter as the input
        initial_birth_scale: The initial scale parameter that is used at the
            start of the experiment
        death_waiting_distribution: A function that samples waiting times
            from the death distribution. Determines how often deaths occur.
            Default is no-death.
        mutation_distribution: A function that samples the number of
            mutations that occur at a division event. If None, then no
            mutations are sampled
        fitness_distribution: One of the two elements in determining the
            multiplicative coefficient of a fitness mutation. A function that
            samples the exponential that the fitness base is raised by.
            Determines the distribution of fitness mutation strengths. Must not
            be None if mutation_distribution provided
        fitness_base: One of the two elements in determining the
            multiplicative strength of a fitness mutation. The base that is
            raised by the value given by the fitness distribution. Determines
            the base strength of fitness mutations. By default is e, Euler's
            Constant
        num_extant: Specifies the number of extant lineages existing at the
            same time as a stopping condition for the experiment
        experiment_time: Specifies the total time that the experiment runs as a
            stopping condition for the experiment
        collapse_unifurcations: Specifies whether to collapse unifurcations in
            the tree resulting from pruning dead lineages
        prune_dead_lineages: Whether or not to prune dead (unobserved) lineages.
            Can be more efficient to not prune, and instead compute statistics
            on living lineages downstream.
        random_seed: A seed for reproducibility
        initial_copy_number: Initial copy number for parental lineage.
        cosegregation_coefficient: A coefficient describing how likely it is for
            one species to be co-inherited with one specific species (currently
            modeled as the first in the array).
            TODO: how do we make this generalizable to multiple species each
            with different pairwise covariances?
        splitting_function: As implemented, the function that describes
            segregation of each species at cell division.
            TODO: fix this implementation to allow for non-independent
            segregation.
        fitness_array: Fitnesses with respect to copy number of each species in
            a cell. This should be a matrix in R^e (where e is the number of
            ecDNA species being modelled).
        fitness_function: A function that produces a fitness value as a function
            of copy number and the selection coefficient encoded by the fitness
            array.
        capture_efficiency: Probability of observing an ecDNA species. Used as
            the the probability of a binomial process.

    Raises:
        TreeSimulatorError if invalid stopping conditions are provided or if a
        fitness distribution is not provided when a mutation distribution isn't
