        Subsets the leaves of a CassiopeiaTree to those within a region of
        interest. The region of interest is defined by a bounding box or numpy
        mask. Both no downsampling and downsampling defined by a ratio or a
        number_of_leaves is supported. If a mask is provided and merge_cells
        is True, cells contained within the same pixel in the space are merged.

        Args:
            bounding_box: A list of tuples of the form (min, max) for each
                dimension of the bounding box.
            space: Numpy array mask representing the space that cells will be 
                sampled from. For example, to sample cells on a 2D circular 
                surface, this argument will be a boolean Numpy array where the 
                circular surface is indicated with True.
            ratio: Specifies the number of leaves to be sampled as a ratio of
                the total number of leaves in the region of interest
            number_of_leaves: Explicitly specifies the number of leaves to be 
                sampled
            attribute_key: The key in the CassiopeiaTree's node attributes
                that contains the spatial coordinates of the leaves.
            merge_cells: Whether or not to merge cells contained within the 
                same pixel in the space. If True, cells are merged to create a
                new cell with ambiguous character states centered at the pixel.

        Subsets the leaves of a CassiopeiaTree to those within a region of

        All fields on the original character matrix persist, but maintains

        Has the option to keep the single edge leading from the root in the
        induced subtree, if it exists. This edge is often used to represent the
        time that the root lives before any divisions occur in the phyologeny,
        and is useful in instances where the branch lengths are critical, like
        simulating ground truth phylogenies or estimating branch lengths.
