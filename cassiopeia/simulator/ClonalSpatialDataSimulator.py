    Simulate spatial data with a clonal spatial autocorrelation constraint.

    This subclass of `SpatialDataSimulator` simulates the spatial coordinates of
    each cell in the provided `CassiopeiaTree` with spatial constraints such
    that subclones are more likely to be spatially autocorrelated.

    The simulation procedure is as follows.
    1. N coordinates are randomly sampled in space, where N is the number of
        leaves. Note that there is no mapping between leaves and coordinates
        (yet). All N coordinates are assigned to the root of the tree.
    2. The tree is traversed from the root to the leaves. At each node, the
        coordinates assigned to that node are split according to the number of
        leaves in each child. A spatial constraint is applied to this step by
        iteratively assigning each coordinate to the spatially closest child.

    Args:
        shape: Shape of the space to place cells on. For instance, (100, 100)
            means a 2D surface of 100x100 pixels. By default in two dimensions
            (length is 2), an elliptical surface is used. In higher dimensions,
            the entire (hyper)cuboid is used.
        space: Numpy array mask representing the space that cells may be placed.
            For example, to place cells on a 2D circlular surface, this argument
            will be a boolean Numpy array where the circular surface is
            indicated with True.
