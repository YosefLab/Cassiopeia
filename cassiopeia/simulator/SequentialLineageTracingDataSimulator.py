A Sequential lineage tracing data simulator. This is a subclass of the

class SequentialLineageTracingDataSimulator(LineageTracingDataSimulator):
    """Simulates Cas9-based lineage tracing data.

    This subclass of `LineageTracingDataSimulator` implements the `overlay_data`
    function to simulate Cas9-based edits onto a defined sequential recording 
    site, aka "DNA tape" or "cassette". These cassettes are designed such that 
    only one site can be edited at a time and the position of the active site
    shifts as edits are made. One example of this type of lineage recorder is 
    the DNA Typewriter system described by Choi et al, Nature 2022.

    First, the class accepts several parameters that govern the Cas9-based 
    tracer. These are 1. the initiation rate which describes the rate at which 
    particular cassette starts recording and 2. the continuation rate which
    describes the rate at which sequential events occur once recording has 
    started. We model Cas9 recording as an exponential process, 
    parameterized by the specified initiation and continuation rates.
     
    Second, the class accepts the architecture of the recorder - described by
    the size of the cassette (by default 3) and the number of cassettes. The
    resulting lineage will have (size_of_cassette * number_of_cassettes)
    characters.

    Third, the class accepts a state distribution describing the relative
    likelihoods of various states. This is very useful, as the probability of 
    different editing outcomes can vary greatly.

    Finally, the class accepts two types of silencing rates. The first is the
    heritable silencing rate which is a rare event in which an entire cassette
    is transcriptionally silenced and therefore not observed. The second type
    of silencing is a stochastic dropout rate which simulates the loss of
    cassettes due to the low sensitivity of the RNA-sequencing assay.

    The function `overlay_data` will operate on the tree in place and will
    specifically modify the data stored in the character attributes.

    Args:
        number_of_cassettes: Number of cassettes (i.e., arrays of target sites)
        size_of_cassette: Number of editable target sites per cassette
        initiation_rate: Exponential parameter for the Cas9 initiation rate
        continuation_rate: Exponential parameter for the Cas9 continuation rate
        state_priors: An optional dictionary mapping states to their prior 
            probabilities.
        heritable_silencing_rate: Silencing rate for the cassettes, per node,
            simulating heritable missing data events.
        stochastic_silencing_rate: Rate at which to randomly drop out cassettes,
            to simulate dropout due to low sensitivity of assays.
        heritable_missing_data_state: Integer representing data that has gone
            missing due to a heritable event (i.e. Cas9 resection or heritable
            silencing).
        stochastic_missing_data_state: Integer representing data that has
            gone missing due to the stochastic dropout from single-cell assay
            sensitivity.
        random_seed: Numpy random seed to use for deterministic simulations.
            Note that the numpy random seed gets set during every call to
            `overlay_data`, thereby producing deterministic simulations every
            time this function is called.

    Raises:
        DataSimulatorError if assumptions about the system are broken.
